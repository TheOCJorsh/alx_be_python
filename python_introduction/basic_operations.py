# This is a File to practice basic arithmetic operations
# Define two variables
number1 = 10
number2 = 5

# Calculate results
sum_result = number1 + number2
difference_result = number1 - number2   # subtract number2 from number1
product_result = number1 * number2

# Print results in the requested format
print(f"Addition of {number1} and {number2} is {sum_result}")
print(f"Subtraction of {number1} and {number2} is {difference_result}")
print(f"Multiplication of {number1} and {number2} is {product_result}")
